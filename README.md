A virtual stack of task priority cards project.

**I'm approaching this project as a learning tool.**
- Understand from first principles
- Don't just find and replicate code examples. I'll use generative AI to help me understand how to do the next phase(s)
development, but I will deliberately include in the prompts to not provide example code. Instead, I'll ask something like
"I'm interested in achieving X in code, can you suggest some topics, with links, that I should study to enable me to do that?".
That way, I'll have to figure it out for myself, understand it, and know it by the time I'm done.
- Build in stepwise phases, starting with one rectangle centered on the page
